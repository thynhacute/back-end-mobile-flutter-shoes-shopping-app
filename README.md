## INTRODUCTION
### IDEA
Customers find it difficult to find, compare and choose the right shoe models.
Moreover, finding a store full of different models and brands is difficult.
Besides, customers have to move to the store, which consumes a lot of time and travel costs.
When a customer has questions, comments or wants to complain about a new pair of shoes, it is difficult to contact the staff directly for advice.
One of the worrisome problems is that customers feel awkward if they go to buy offline or call for advice, ask too many questions but do not buy any products at all.

## SOLUTION:
Convenient shopping experience: Customers can easily browse products, search, compare prices and choose the products they like without having to travel to stores.
Wide product selection: A shoe web can offer customers a wide range of shoe products ranging from running shoes to high heels, from different manufacturers. This allows customers to search and select products that suit their needs.
Save time and money: Not only do customers not have to travel to the store, but they also don't have to spend time commuting. In addition, products are often more competitively priced and can be discounted regularly, helping to save on procurement costs.
Customer Support Service: Shoe stores often offer customer support to answer customer inquiries and respond to requests. In addition, stores can provide instructions on how to care for their shoes so that customers' products can be kept in the best possible condition.
Feel free to look up information about shoes, easily check the size or quantity of inventory without direct advice from staff -> customers will not feel awkward anymore.
